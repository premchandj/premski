Missing money
puzzle
It is a dark and stormy night when three travelers must stop in hotel.
They approach the front desk, where the front desk clerk informs them of
the rate of $30 for three men in one room. The men each hand over a $10
bill for a total of $30. They are given a key and go to their room.
Moments later, the manager is informed of the transaction and reprimands
the clerk, reminding him of the 3 men/1 room special of $25 a night. The
manager asks the clerk to refund the $5 to the men. Taking five $1 bills
from the register, he goes to the men\'s room and knocks on the door.
While he waits for the men to come to the door, he realizes a problem.
How can he divide the 5 $1 bills evenly among the men? When they answer
the door, he tells them that there was a special that night and that the
total bill only came to $27. He gave them each $1 as a refund, and the
sneaky clerk made off with $2 for himself. Though it seems everyone came
out a winner, a problem occurs. In the beginning, $30 was paid. In the
end, however, the man had paid a collective $27, and the clerk had $2.
$27 + $2 =$29, not $30. The question is: where is the extra dollar?

However, you can only write to it through a byte mask (if bit of byte
mask ==1, then you can write to that bit, if == 0, the bit stays
unchanged). Also, you can not read the byte mask (you can only change
it). How do you determine what the value of the byte mask is (you can
write to the video card as long as it is restored to the same condition
as you left it)

pointer to the next block in the disk which will store the next part of
the file and so on. A block which stores the end of a file points to
null. Also a block whose unused bit is 0 doesnt point to anything and is
not pointed to by any block. Now u have an index of files with filename
as index and the value as the first block in which the file starts.Lets
says u somehow lose these indices and values. How will you find an

Yarr Maties
puzzle
Five pirates discover a chest full of 100 gold coins. The pirates are ranked by their years of service, Pirate 5 having five years of service, Pirate 4 four years, and so on down to Pirate 1 with only one year of deck scrubbing under his belt. To divide up the loot, they agree on the following:

    The most senior pirate will propose a distribution of the booty. All pirates will then vote, including the most senior pirate, and if at least 50% of the pirates on board accept the proposal, the gold is divided as proposed. If not, the most senior pirate is forced to walk the plank and sink to Davy Jonesâ€™ locker. Then the process starts over with the next most senior pirate until a plan is approved.

These pirates are not your ordinary swashbucklers. Besides their democratic leanings, they are also perfectly rational and know exactly how the others will vote in every situation. Emotions play no part in their decisions. Their preference is first to remain alive, and next to get as much gold as possible and finally, if given a choice between otherwise equal outcomes, to have fewer pirates on the boat.

The most senior pirate thinks for a moment and then proposes a plan that maximizes his gold, and which he knows the others will accept. How does he divide up the coins? What plan would the most senior pirate propose on a boat full of 15 pirates?

Switches

The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, "You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.

"In the prison is a switch room, which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the \'on\' or the \'off\' position. I am not telling you their present positions. The switches are not connected to anything.

"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can\'t move both but he can\'t move none either. Then he\'ll be led back to his cell.

"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he\'ll be instructed to do the same thing. I\'m going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.

"But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time anyone of you may declare to me, \'We have all visited the switch room.\' and be 100% sure.

A prison warden has randomly picked one prisoner among three to go free. The other two will
be executed. The guard knows which one will go free but is forbidden to give any prisoner
information regarding his status. Let us call the prisoners X, Y, and Z. Prisoner X asks the
guard privately which of Y or Z will be executed,arguing that since he already knows that at
least one of them must die, the guard won\'t be revealing any information about his own status.
The guard tells X that Y is to be executed. Prisoner X feels happier now, since he figures that
either he or prisoner Z will go free, which means that his probability of going free is now 1/2.
Is he right, or are his chances still 1/3? Explain

Pebbles
puzzles,coding
You are given an array ARR of size 2n + 1 (which are numbered from -n to 0 to

throughout the array such that each element in the array contains exactly 1
pebble. However, you have just one operation to move the pebbles - f(i).
On applying this function on the \'i\' th postion [ where \'i\' ranges from -n to
0 to +n ], one of the pebble moves from \'i\' to \'i-1\' and another pebble moves
from \'i\' to \'i+1\'. Such an operation f(i) can be performed on position \'i\',
if ARR[i] has atleast 2 pebbles in it. Write an optimal algo to solve this problem
===
Heap problem
algorithms,coding
Consider a binary heap containing n numbers (the root stores the greatest number). You are given a positive integer k < n and a number x . You have to determine whether the kth largest element of the heap is greater than x or not. Your algorithm must take O(k) time. You may use O(k) extra storage.

Hint : I think you are trying to find the kth largest element in the heap in O(k) time in order to solve this problem. But actually, you need not find the kth largest element in the heap to solve this problem. You will be able to solve the problem if you are able to find whether the number of elements in the heap which are greater than x are more/less/equal to k . Now exploit the definition of the heap, to do this task in O(k) time. Note that you have extra O(k) storage space to use.
===
Binary search tree twist
algorithms,coding
You are given a special binary search tree where each node contains the
number of nodes in its child-trees in addition to the key.

Example.

10,5
/ \
/ \
5,3 15,0
/ \
/ \
2,0 6,1
\
\
7,0

(a,b) => a is the key
b is the number of nodes in the child trees.

Now the problem is given any two values, give an algorithm with minimum time
complexity, which gives the number of values in between the two given values
in the sorted array.

For example given 2 & 7, it should give 2 (since 5 & 6 are there in between
2 & 7).

Blocks
system,algorithms
Lets say you have a disk of size N with N blocks. Every block stores part of a file. Every file starts from a single block. The block size is not enough to store a file. Every block has a used/unused bit and a pointer to the next block in the disk which will store the next part of the file and so on. A block which stores the end of a file points to null. Also a block whose unused bit is 0 doesnt point to anything and is not pointed to by any block. Now u have an index of files with filename as index and the value as the first block in which the file starts.Lets says u somehow lose these indices and values. How will you find an efficient algorithm to recreate this index structure with values. You can use any filenames while creating the indices. (While solving one shld think of cases where the file starts at block 4 which points to 1 then to 2 and ends at 3)

You play this game with one other player: Starting with an ampty rectangular table like this one, and an unlimited supply of quarters, each person takes a turn by putting a quarter anywhere in the table. The rules say only that you must place your quarter so that it doesn\'t touch any quarter already on the table. You and your opponent take turns placing quarters in succession, until the table is nearly full of quarters. The first player who is unable to add a quarter without touching a quarter already placed loses.

Demons and Dwarfs
puzzle
An evil demon captures a large, unspecified number of dwarfs. At each dwarf’s entry interview, the demon plants a red or green gem in the dwarf’s forehead. The demon informs the new recruit:

    * that he, the dwarf, has an unremovable red or green jewel in his forehead

    * that he, the demon, is not going to tell him which color, nor will anyone else (the dwarfs are strictly forbidden to communicate)

    * that one of the colors denotes sniveling company spies and the other color denotes those particularly lucklyess captives who are not even snivelying company spies

    * that the demon does not choose to tell him which color denotes which, nor will he tell him ever.

End of entry interview.

Every day the dwarfs line up in formation so that the demon can count them, just to make sure no one has escaped.

One day the demon gets tired of the dwarfs and decides to get rid of them. He announces that he will set the dwarfs free, provided they all deduce the color of their gems. As a hint, he tells them that there is at least one dwarf with a red gem, and at least one with a green gem. To earn their collective freedom, the dwarfs must signal wordlessly at the daily lineup. All the dwarfs with red gems are to step one pace forward, while the dwarfs with green gems remain behind. If they are correct, then all the dwarfs are free to go back to their homes in the coal mines. If they are not correct, all the dwarfs will be slaughtered on the spot.

The dwarfs are free to take as long as they want to determine the colors of their gems. They are all perfectly logical, and are all dying to get back to their homes. What should they do?

The array arr consists of balls of with one of the three colours
(Red,Green,Blue). Now we need to sort the array in such a way that all
the Red coloured balls come first, followed by blue and then green.

The restriction is that call to function ColorOfBall is a very costly
operation. You have to use it as less as possible. (In other words we
would be looking for the solution with least number of calls to the
function ColorOfBall.)
